**EDIT:** See my post on a [design doc for a multi-tenant orchestrator](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/secret-design-docs-multi-tenant-orchestrator/) instead. 
I wrote this when an internal requirement was to use Kubernetes but I do not personally think you should use Kubernetes for this use case.

Kubernetes is the new kernel. We can refer to it as a “cluster kernel” versus 
the typical operating system kernel. This means a lot of great things for users 
trying to deploy applications. It also leads to a lot of the same challenges we 
have already faced with operating system kernels. One of which being privilege 
isolation. In Kubernetes, we refer to this as multi-tenancy, or the dream of 
being able to isolate tenants of a cluster.

The 
[models for multi-tenancy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15w1_fesSUZHv-vwjiYa9vN_uyc--PySRoLKTuDhimjc/edit#heading=h.3dawx97e3hz6) 
have been discussed at length in the 
[community’s multi-tenancy working group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SkVdOPR4jozYDT8ro51hU3yrf1sHS8Gez73xM3PCsVo/edit). 
**NOTE: to view most of these Google docs you need to be a member of the
[kubernetes-wg-multitenancy Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-wg-multitenancy).**
There have also been [some proposals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fj3yzmeU2eU8ZNBCUJG97dk_wC7228-e_MmdcmTNrZY/edit) 
offered to solve each model. The current model of tenancy in Kubernetes assumes 
the cluster is the security boundary. You can build a SaaS on top of Kubernetes 
but you need to bring your own trusted API and not just use the Kubernetes API. 
Of course, with that comes [a lot of considerations you must also think about
when building your cluster securely for a SaaS even](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PjlsBmZw6Jb3XZeVyZ0781m6PV7-nSUvQrwObkvz7jg/edit).

The model I am going to be focusing on for this post is “hard multi-tenancy.” 
This implies that tenants do not trust each other and are assumed to be actively 
malicious and untrustworthy. Hard multi-tenancy means multiple tenants in the 
same cluster should not have access to anything from other tenants. In this 
model, the goal is to have the security boundary be the Kubernetes namespace object.

The hard multi-tenancy model has not been solved yet, but there have been
[a few proposals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fj3yzmeU2eU8ZNBCUJG97dk_wC7228-e_MmdcmTNrZY/edit ). 
All systems have weaknesses and nothing is perfect. With a system as complex and 
large as Kubernetes it is hard to trust the entire system to not be vulnerable. 
In this regard and in the regard of the existing proposals, one single exploit 
in Kubernetes leads to full supervisor privileges and then it’s game over.

This is not an acceptable way to secure a system and guarantee isolation 
between tenants. I will cover in this post why having more than one layer of 
security is so important. 

The attack surface with the highest risk of logical vulnerabilities is the 
Kubernetes API. This must be isolated between tenants. The attack surface with 
the highest risk of remote code execution are the services running in containers. 
These must also be isolated between tenants.

If you take one look at the open source repository and the speed to which 
Kubernetes is growing, it is already taking on a lot of the same aspects of 
the monolithic kernels of Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and FreeBSD. Fortunately, 
there have already been a lot of solutions to privilege separation in monolithic
kernels researched and implemented.

The solution I am going to focus on is 
[Nested Kernel: Intra-Kernel Isolation](http://nathandautenhahn.com/downloads/publications/asplos200-dautenhahn.pdf).
This paper solves the problem of privilege isolation in monolithic kernels by 
nesting a small kernel inside the monolithic kernel.

## More than One Layer of Security Required

What we know of today as “sandboxes” are defined as having multiple layers of 
security. For example, the sandbox I made for the
[contained.af](https://contained.af) playground has 
security layers defined by seccomp, apparmor, kernel namespaces, cgroups, 
capabilities, and an unprivileged Linux user. All those layers don’t necessarily 
overlap, but a few do. If a user was to have an apparmor or seccomp bypass and 
they tried to call `mount` inside the container, the Linux capability of 
`CAP_SYS_ADMIN` would still prevent them from executing `mount`. 

These layers ensure that one vulnerability in the system does not take out the 
entire security of the system. We need this for hard multi-tenancy in Kubernetes 
as well. This is why all the existing proposals are insufficient. We need at 
least two layers and these comprise only one.

With intra-kernel isolation applied to Kubernetes, we get two layers. Let me 
dive in a bit deeper into how this would work.

## Isolation via Namespaces

The existing proposals for hard multi-tenancy assume that the security boundary 
for multiple users on Kubernetes would be the namespace. “Namespace” in this 
regard being those defined by Kubernetes. The proposals all have the weakness 
that if you exploit one part of Kubernetes you can then have privileges to 
transverse namespaces and therefore transverse the tenants.

With Intra-Kernel Isolation, the namespace would still be the security boundary. 
However, instead of all sharing the main Kubernetes system services, each 
namespace would have it’s own “nested” Kubernetes system services. Meaning 
the api-server, kube-proxy, etc would all be running individually in a pod 
in that namespace. The tenant who deploys to that namespace would then have 
no access to the actual root-level Kubernetes system services but merely the 
ones running in their namespace. An exploit in Kubernetes would not be game 
over for the whole system, but only game-over within that namespace. 

Another security boundary would also be the container isolation itself. These 
pods could be further locked down by the existing resources like 
`PodSecurityPolicy` and `NetworkPolicy`. With the ever growing innovation in 
the ecosystem, you could even run VMs (katacontainers) for hardware-isolation 
between containers giving you the highest level of security between the services 
in your cluster.

For those familiar with Linux namespaces you can think of this as a `clone` 
for Kubernetes. The design is roughly similar.

For example on linux cloning new namespaces looks like:

```c
clone(CLONE_NEWNS | CLONE_NEWIPC | CLONE_NEWUTS | CLONE_NEWNET | CLONE_NEWPID… )
```

So when you create a new Kubernetes namespace with intra-kernel isolation this 
roughly translates to, purely example not to be taken literally:

```c
clone(CLONE_NEWAPISERVER | CLONE_NEWKVSTORE | CLONE_NEWKUBEPROXY | CLONE_NEWKUBEDNS…)
```

In Linux, namespaces control what a process can see. This holds true for users 
designated to a namespace in Kubernetes. Since each namespace would have its 
own system services that would be all they could see. 

Unlike the pseudo code above, the Kubernetes namespace will automatically get 
new components of each system service. This is more in line with the design of 
Solaris Zones or FreeBSD Jails. 

In my blog post 
[Setting the Record Straight: containers vs. Zones vs. Jails vs. VMs](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/containers-zones-jails-vms/), 
I go over the differences between those various isolation techniques. 
In this design, we are more inline with that of Zones or Jails. Containers come 
with all the parts. The namespaces in Kubernetes should automatically set up a 
well isolated world, just like that of Zones or Jails without the user having 
to worry about if they configured it correctly.

Another problem with namespaces in Linux is that 
[not everything is namespaced](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/two-objects-not-namespaced-linux-kernel/). 
This design ensures that every part of Kubernetes is isolated per tenant.

## Isolation via Resource Control

There are still a few unanswered questions just with the design above alone. 
Let’s take a look at another control mechanism in Linux: `cgroups`. 
Cgroups control what a process can use. They are the masters of resource control. 

This concept would need to be applied to Kubernetes namespaces as well. Rather 
than controlling resources like memory consumption and CPU, it would apply to 
nodes. The tenant within a namespace would only be able to access certain nodes
designated to it. All the namespace services would be isolated at the machine 
level as well. No services from different tenants would run on the same machine. 
This could always be a setting in the future but the default should be that 
nodes are not shared.

This model allows for designating to our nested API server a set of kubelets 
on various nodes to use. 

At this point we have isolation of what a tenant can see (Kubernetes namespace)
and what they can use (nodes designated to a namespace).

Alternatively, if the system services for the namespaces were isolated with 
nested VM containers (katacontainers) and you considered all the other variables 
outlined in [this design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PjlsBmZw6Jb3XZeVyZ0781m6PV7-nSUvQrwObkvz7jg/edit). Then those services could share nodes. This
would give you a bit better resource utilization than above. It is illustrated below.


![mtimage1.png](/img/mtimage1.png)


Taking it even a step further for even better resource utilization, if you 
isolated the whole system and containers into fully sandboxed or VM containers 
as per [this design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PjlsBmZw6Jb3XZeVyZ0781m6PV7-nSUvQrwObkvz7jg/edit), then all services could share nodes. This is illustrated below.

## Tenants that Span Multiple Namespaces

A few times it has been brought up in the working group that tenants might need 
to span multiple namespaces. While I don’t believe this should be a default, 
I don’t see a problem with it.

Let’s take a look again at how namespaces work in Linux and how we use them 
for containers. Each namespace is a file descriptor. You can share a namespace 
between containers by designating the file descriptor for the namespace you want
to share and calling `setns`.

In Kubernetes, we could implement the same sort of design. A superuser can 
delegate a namespace is to be shared between tenants with access to that namespace.

Overall this design uses the expertise from past art of kernel isolation
techniques. It is also designed with the lessons learned from past kernel 
isolation techniques.

With the growing ecosystem and core of Kubernetes it’s important to have more 
than one layer of security between tenants. Security techniques such as failsafe
defaults, complete mediation, least privilege, and least common mechanism are 
very popular but hard to apply to monolithic kernels. Kubernetes by default 
shares everything and has many different, sometimes very broken, drivers and 
plugins just like that of an operating system kernel. Applying the same 
isolation techniques of kernels to Kubernetes will allow for a better privilege 
isolation solution.

## Where does this leave us?

We have fully isolated and solved our threat model in a very strong way. 
The attack surface with the highest risk of logical vulnerabilities, the 
Kubernetes API, has full logical separation in that each tenant has their own. 
The attack surface with the highest risk of remote code execution, containers 
themselves, have full virtualized separation from other tenants. This isolation
either comes from isolating via designated nodes themselves to tenants or by 
running containers that use hardware isolation. The only viable path to other 
tenants is getting remote code execution in some service, then breaking out of 
the container (and/or VM).

The first diagram of intra-kernel isolation via node resource control illustrates 
close to the same as having two fully separate clusters operated by one superuser.
Since nodes are designated to each tenant, you do not really gain more efficient 
resource utilization either. 

The model with the highest gain of resource control comes from securely setting
up your cluster to use nested virtual machines as containers or fully sandboxing 
the containers themselves so that the boundary is the container not the node. 
This eases the operators pain of running more than one cluster and allows 
resources to be used more effectively while also sustaining more than one
layer of security.

None of this is set in stone. This is my idea for solving this problem. If
you are interested in discussing this or other aspects of tenancy in Kubernetes
please join the [working group](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-multitenancy). I look forward to discussing this there. Thanks!
